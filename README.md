# S5: React

This webpage is built on React using JavaScript. The project has been created by Vite. In this exercise, I created some small components (like bottons) and used them in bigger ones. I also used "useState" in the slider and accordion to control which component should be displayed.

## Requirements
Before running the project, make sure you have Node.js (version 16 or higher) installed:

## Installation and Execution
You can clone this project by typing the following command in your terminal:
`git clone https://github.com/Mika7596/S5-React.git`
Navigate into the project foler `cd S5-REACT`
Type `npm install` to install all dependencies.
Now run the program by `npm start` and `npm run dev` then open the link available in your terminal to visualize the webpage.

## Contributions
I'd be grateful for any comments on my code. If there are any errors / bad practices, let me know by posting a new issue on this repo. Thank you!
